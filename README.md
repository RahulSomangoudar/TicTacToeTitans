# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O').

## How to Play

To play the game, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game interface will be displayed, and you can start playing immediately.

Each player takes turns to click on an empty cell to place their symbol. The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or until the board is full (resulting in a draw).
