# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking spaces with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O').

## How to Play

To play the game, run the `tictactoe.py` file in a Python environment. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your moves.

Each player takes turns to place their symbol in an empty cell. The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or until the board is full (resulting in a draw).
